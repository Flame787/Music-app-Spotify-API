Initial purpose of this app was to rate songs and albums and create music lists (similar to a Todo-list). 
But additionally I wanted to connect the app with Spotify-API, to create a real music app experience.  
The app uses Javascript ES6 on frontend, Express.js on backend (authentification) and SCSS for styling.
