'Music Domain' app can be used to search for music artists, songs and albums. It displays results provided by Spotify API. 
Users can research and listen to individual song previews or preview entire albums. They can also like, save to playlist and play their favorite track's previews. 
Full songs and artist's data are easily accessible via external Spotify links.
Besides of these main functions, users can also smoothly personalize the app by browsing between 16 different style themes. 
This app uses Vanilla Javascript ES6 on frontend, Express.js on backend (for Spotify authentification and API communication) and SCSS for styling.

To start the app locally:
1. Install dependencies: npm install
2. Start the backend server: node server.js
