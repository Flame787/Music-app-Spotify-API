Users can listen to individual song previews or play entire albums. 
They can also like, save to playlist and play their favorite track's previews. 
Full songs and artist's data are easily accessible via external Spotify links.  
Besides of these main functions, users can also smoothly personalize the app by browsing between 16 different style themes.
